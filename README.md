ReSocket.io
---

This is a dead simple wrapper for socket.io. It supports `on`, `emit` and `broadcast` on both the client and the server.

To build everything run `npm run all` and to run the demo run `node mainserver.js` and go to `localhost:3000` on two tabs. You can send messages back and forth!
